# This test calls subtree commands but doesn't name the remote
# explicitly, the script determines it implicitly from the cwd.

# TODO: adjust this test to work in the root dir (get rid of updir)
# TODO: add a pull command, the combo of a fetch and a merge
# TODO: remember the branch we're on somehow
# TODO: add a checkout command to switch the branch your subtree is on?
# TODO: the difference between merge and update is pretty artificial.
# TODO: switch to using a branch rather than a squash
# TODO: remove the need to commit the results after merging
